# Polynomial
Polynomial was created by Michael Andersen as a Java class for working with Polynomials.
This was done as an educational project and is not intended to replace already developed tools which accomplish the same goal.
To date Polynomial supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division all by polynomials and constants. 
It also supports evaluation and finding derivates, integrals, and roots.
More functionality may be implemented at a later date.
